### 1. What is in here
This repository is currently set up for local development and it utilizes [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) provider to emulate production environment on Windows, OS X and Linux.

You should [read more on Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html) if you're not familiar with it
before you proceed.

Supported box types are: loadbalancer, application, database, magento2. Initial `vagrant up` will spin up 
everything that you need to have local setup available at `star.commerce.dev`, `magento2.api.provider` and/or 
`magento2.dev` on you machine after following setup below and depending on what environment are you setting up.

Also, there might be other boxes in the future, so check out *Setup* section below in the future if you have any issues.

*This repo is a modified version of of [generated Puphpet template](https://puphpet.com/). Check it out, it's awesome!
Also, all requirements they have, we have as well...*

### Setup
Setup is fairly simple as it consists of just 6 steps:

  1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
  2. Clone this repository to your machine 
  3. From project root, run `init.sh` shell script (initializes dependencies)
  4. Copy file `puphpet/boxes/<ENVIRONMENT>/hiera/magento2_data.yaml.dist` to `puphpet/boxes/<ENVIRONMENT>/hiera/magento2_data.yaml` and update 
  contents of copied file. Magento connect data is mandatory in order to get `magento2` box up and running. Instructions 
  are available here: 
  ([magento connect credentials](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/customerdata/secureKeys/list/))
  5. Run `sh command.sh <ENVIRONMENT> <VAGRANT_COMMAND>` (i.e. `sh command.sh STARCommerce up`)
  6. Update your [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)#Location_in_the_file_system) as described below
  in [Environments](README.md#environments) section
  
### Environments
Currently available environments are:
  - STARCommerce
  - Magento2
  
Both of them require 
[Magento connect key pair]((https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/customerdata/secureKeys/list/)) in order to 
be fully and correctly provisioned. 

#### "STARCommerce" environment
  - STAR Commerce application will be accessible through load balancer at
[http://star.commerce.dev](http://star.commerce.dev) and Magento 2 installation at 
[http://magento2.api.provider](http://magento2.api.provider).
  - Hosts setup: append `192.168.56.100 star.commerce.dev` and `192.168.56.102 magento2.api.provider` lines to your 
[hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)#Location_in_the_file_system)

#### "Magento2" environment
  - Magento 2 will be accessible through load balancer at
[http://magento2.dev](http://star.commerce.dev).
  - Hosts setup: append `192.168.56.100 magento2.dev`line to your 
[hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)#Location_in_the_file_system)

To see what's exactly happening, check out `*.yaml` files in `/puphpet/boxes` directory

### Road map and current state of the project
Original road map planning is available at our [corporate blog](http://the-shop.io/star-commerce-roadmap/) and we're 
**currently in phase of working on 
[STARCommerceFrontend application](https://github.com/the-shop/STARCommerceFrontend)**.

This repository contains entire infrastructure definition and all repositories it depends on described through Vagrant 
and Puppet files.

### Notes
  1. Tested on Ubuntu 15.10 (Vagrant v1.7.4 and VirtualBox v5.0.10)
  2. READMEs are perhaps not 100% accurate, please file any issues via 
  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/the-shop/STARCommerceFrontend/issues)
  3. Load Balancer statistics can be accessed at `http://star.commerce.dev/haproxy?stats` with username `haproxy` and 
  password `password` - that can be changed in `/puphpet/boxes/hiera/loadbalancer.yaml` file
