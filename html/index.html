                    <h3>However, if you are seeing this page, it means you are using IP Address, not virtual host!</h3>

                    <p>This is probably not the page you want.</p>

                    <p>
                        This page is being served from <code>/var/www/html/index.html</code>, and is the default
                        vhost (virtual host) that comes with most web servers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What you probably need to do is to add a vhost record on your machine to get this to run as
                        intended.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On OSX and Linux, this is located at <code>/etc/hosts</code>, on Windows it is located at
                        <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Add following line with the IP address of load balancer to your hosts file to be able to see
                        what we're working on.
